# Exercise-3-Java
- My first Java Coding - Refresh! 🌿

I took my past university minor assignment on brushing up memory skills of Java and understanding the concept once more. 💫

In this repo, I have learnt to code the following: 👩‍🎓💻
1. Write a program to allow user **enter an integer type number** and the program will 
**check if the number is positive or negative.**
2. Write a program to display the **name of the day** with a number between 1 and 7, 
otherwise display an **error message.**
3. Write a program to prompt user to **enter a mark** and the program will display the 
**grade of the mark.**
4. Write a program to allow user to **enter 3 integer** type numbers and the program 
will find **largest and smallest** number among them. 
5. Write a program that allows user to **enter a number between 1 to 9999**,
     and determine the **number of digits**.

## GitHub Lesson Learnt 🔍📝 ## 
As a newbie GitHub + my first coding journey here, I'll need to reflect myself of understanding the configuration terminal in github!
- git add .
- git commit -m "My first Java Coding - Refresh!"
- git push origin main

  ## End of Lesson - Thank You! ##
